# Banker's Algorithm

## Project Description

The Banker's Algorithm is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm designed to allocate resources to processes in a way that prevents deadlock. It is primarily used in operating systems for managing resources in a multi-tasking environment. The algorithm ensures that resource allocation will not result in a deadlock by simulating the allocation and determining whether the system will remain in a safe state.

## Features

- **Deadlock Avoidance**: The algorithm helps to prevent the occurrence of deadlock situations by ensuring safe resource allocation.
- **Resource Safety Control**: By analyzing resource allocation and predicting future demands, the system ensures that it remains in a safe state.
- **Multi-tasking Systems**: The algorithm is useful in environments with multiple tasks or users, where resource allocation must be carefully managed.
